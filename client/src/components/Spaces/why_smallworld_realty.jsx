              We spent approximately one-third of our day at work. What defines a
              good work space and what are the factors that contribute to
              productivity and results?
              <br />
              <br />
              SmallWorld actively explores these components to ensure that we can
              deliver the best work environment for you! SmallWorld Realty spaces are
              located in commercial areas of Phnom Penh, acting as a convenient
              headquarters for professionals and start-ups.

              <br />
              We start with the basics. Each SmallWorld Realty spaces are clean,
              neat, and minimalist. However, we have a variety of different spaces
              for different needs and preferences. Not all teams want to work in
              cubicles and not all teams want their space too open. That is okay. We
              are here to help!
