              What if your team likes your space a little unconventional? We’d like
              to introduce you to a more homely option. Small World Pteas Boran
              offers multiple array of rooms to choose from, each of which has its
              own charm. It isn’t your typical white-wall, glass-door kind of room
              and maybe that is why your team might like it more!
